    /// ETRegion is a representation of a physical region that should trigger a message to be presented to the user. This could be either macro, a geofence, or micro, an iBeacon (marketing name: Proximity), but both go through iOS' Location Manager, and are reported back to the SDK through the CLLocationManagerDelegate (which is currently always ETLocationManager).
    /// Geofences will have a latitude and longitude and radius, but will be notably absent of a proximity UUID, major and minor number. Beacons also have latitude and longitude (but no radius) because of a decision to track their physical location in the world, but it is inconsequential to functionality. A beacon is functional because of the Proximity UUID. Major and Minor number. The three of these uniquely identify a physical beacon. Per Apple's best practices (WWDC 2013), a single UUID should be used commonly amongst an entire Enterprise (example: All Starbucks locations share a UUID). Major numbers should designate a single location within the UUID (Starbucks #1234, 15th and College, Indianapolis), and a Minor number can indicate the beacon within the location designated in the Major (Point of Sale). ExactTarget suggests following this pattern when configuring beacons.
    /// ETRegions will has a zero-to-many relationship with ETMessage, which in turn, has a zero-to-many relationship with ETRegion. In plain English, one region can have many messages, and one message can belong to many regions. This is handled through ETFenceMessage.
